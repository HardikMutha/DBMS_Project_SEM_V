## Problem Statement

Travelers seeking outdoor camping experiences often struggle to find verified, well-documented campgrounds online. Existing travel platforms focus mostly on hotels and resorts, leaving campsite owners with little digital visibility. Moreover, booking systems for campgrounds are either scattered or rely on manual coordination. This project aims to develop a dedicated **CampGround Booking Platform** that connects campers with verified campgrounds, offering an intuitive interface for searching, booking, and managing stays — thereby digitizing the camping experience.


## Objectives

1. To provide a **unified platform** for discovering, listing, and booking campgrounds.

2. To allow campground owners to manage their listings, availability, and pricing in real-time.

3. To let users book campgrounds easily with confirmation tracking.

4. To ensure an intuitive, responsive user interface for both desktop and mobile users.

5. To maintain a database of campgrounds with ratings, facilities, and location data.

6. To provide normalized, efficient, and consistent database design up to
**3NF**.
